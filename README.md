## README

This is the static version of the DouglasHelmer.com website.

The site consists primarily of a very simple homepage with some personal info.

In addition, it also contains my residential electrical panel size calculator that I originally put online in 2008. 

There is no hyperlink to the calculator from the homepage because it is a decade out-of-date with the Canadian Electrical Code, but I'm keeping it online for the few who may find it useful from an historical point of view. Go to [https://www.douglashelmer.com/panel/index.htm](the panel page) to see it in action.
